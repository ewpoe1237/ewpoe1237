# :hearts: Hello! My name is *Jenna Hofseth*.
### :cherry_blossom: I graduated in 2023 from *Clemson University* with a _B.S. in C.S._ and a minor in *cybersecurity*. I currently am a _full-time student researcher at Worcester Polytechnic Institute_, working towards an _M.S./Ph.D. in Electrical & Computer Engineering_ with my work focusing on the optimization of distributed mobile wireless mesh networks.
### :sunflower: In June-December 2022, I worked for *LPL Financial* as a *web development intern* with a *front-end focus* and some *full-stack* tie-ins.
### :hibiscus: In June-August 2023, I worked for *MIT Lincoln Laboratory* as a *research intern in the Tactical Networks group* and started a project aiming to discover methods of modeling and alleviating the effects of impaired network communication links on UAV communications in ISR missions, particularly in the context of real-time video transmissions to a ground control station (GCS).
### :white_flower: After graduating in December 2023, I returned to MITLL as a _long-term intern_ until starting my graduate studies in August. During this time, I evaluated and compared different available bandwidth (ABW) estimation tools when being used in an airborne, mobile communication network. Much of this work involved designing a mobile node testbed in Common Open Research Emulator and injecting different characteristics on the network such as packet loss, the use of various mobility models, etc. 
### :rosette: Most of my past work has been in fields including _robotics, network communications, computer vision,_ and _full-stack web development_; however, I am always happy to learn more and have experience in several other areas. Computer science has been a long-time passion of mine, and I hope to use this profile as a development hub to share my professional growth.
